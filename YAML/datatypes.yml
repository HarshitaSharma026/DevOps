# the above code is giving me an error, because we can't add a new line like this alone
# it should be either a list, or it should be written in a name : value type of format

# the correct way to preserve new line and all the indentation is to use "|" symbol
message: |
 this will
 be displayed
 as
 a single line
#  keep in mind the indentation from new line


# write a single line in multiple lines
message: >
 this will

 as
 a single line
